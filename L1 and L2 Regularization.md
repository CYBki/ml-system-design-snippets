# L1 and L2 Regularization in Machine Learning

This document provides a comprehensive explanation of L1 and L2 regularization techniques in machine learning. Here are the main topics:

## Basic Concepts

### Overfitting
A situation where the model performs very well on training data but fails on test data. This occurs when the model learns the noise in the training data as well.

### Bias-Variance Trade-off
- **Bias**: A measure of how much the model deviates from the true value
- **Variance**: A measure of how variable the model's results are across different training samples

As model capacity increases, bias decreases but variance increases. A balance must be struck between these two.

## Regularization

A technique to prevent overfitting by penalizing complex models. Basic principles:
- Adding penalty terms to the loss function
- Weight decay (reducing weights)
- Model simplification

## L1 Regularization (Lasso)

### Mathematical Formula
```
Loss = Error(Y, Ŷ) + λ·Σ|w|
```

### Characteristics
- Penalizes the sum of absolute values of weights
- Produces sparse solutions
- Performs feature selection (sets some weights to zero)
- Useful for high-dimensional datasets
- Computationally more expensive

### Advantages
- Automatic feature selection
- Robust to outliers
- Simple and interpretable models

## L2 Regularization (Ridge)

### Mathematical Formula
```
Loss = Error(Y, Ŷ) + λ·Σw²
```

### Characteristics
- Penalizes the sum of squares of weights
- Non-sparse solutions
- Can solve multicollinearity problems
- Computationally more efficient

### Advantages
- More accurate predictions
- Can learn complex data patterns
- Has analytical solution

## L1 vs L2 Comparison

| Feature | L1 | L2 |
|---------|----|----|
| **Penalty term** | Absolute value | Square |
| **Solution type** | Sparse | Non-sparse |
| **Feature selection** | Yes | No |
| **Computation** | Expensive | Efficient |
| **Outliers** | Robust | Sensitive |
| **Model complexity** | Simple | Complex patterns |

## When to Use Which?

### Choose L1 When:
- You have many features
- Feature selection is needed
- You want a simple, interpretable model
- There are outliers in the data

### Choose L2 When:
- All features are important
- Higher accuracy is required
- There are multicollinearity issues
- Computational efficiency is important

### Elastic Net
A hybrid approach that combines L1 and L2, utilizing the advantages of both.

## Conclusion

Regularization is one of the fundamental building blocks of modern machine learning and is critically important for improving model generalization capabilities.

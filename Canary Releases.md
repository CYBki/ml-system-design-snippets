# A Comprehensive Guide to Canary Releases

## Introduction

To effectively build cloud native applications, engineering organizations must adopt a culture of decentralized decision-making, create supporting platforms, and implement continuous delivery to move faster. This guide explores canary releases as a key pattern in cloud native application development, explaining why they're effective, how to implement them, and their consequences.

## What is a Canary Release?

**Canary release** is a software testing technique used to reduce the risk of introducing a new software version into production by **gradually rolling out the change to a small subset of users** before deploying it to the entire platform/infrastructure.

### Terminology Clarifications

**Synonyms:**
- Canary rollout (functionally identical)
- Canary deployment

**Different from:**
- **Blue-Green Releases:** New version "switched" instantaneously to all users
- **Feature Flag Releases:** Specific feature exposed to subgroup, not entire application version
- **Dark Launch:** Traffic duplicated to new version but responses hidden from users

## Historical Motivation

The technique draws inspiration from coal mining practices where **canary birds served as early warning systems** for toxic gases. The birds would succumb to dangerous gases before affecting miners, providing critical evacuation alerts.

In software deployment:
- **Small user subset = Canaries**
- **Early warning system = Performance metrics and KPIs**
- **No physical harm = Quick rollback capabilities**
- **Continuous monitoring = Ensuring system health**

> As long as the canary kept singing, miners knew the air was safe. If it stopped, immediate evacuation was necessary.

## When to Use Canary Releases

### Appropriate Scenarios ✅

1. **Microservices Architecture**
   - Multiple services changing at independent rates
   - Production-like environment verification required

2. **High Operational Risk**
   - New functionality poses significant deployment risk
   - Small percentage traffic experimentation beneficial

3. **Third-Party Dependencies**
   - Legacy or external systems difficult to test against
   - Only reliable validation through actual integration

### Inappropriate Scenarios ❌

1. **Mission-Critical Systems**
   - Safety or life-critical applications
   - Zero tolerance for failure (e.g., nuclear safety mechanisms)

2. **Sensitive User Experiences**
   - Financial transaction systems requiring extra care
   - User-base highly sensitive to experimental changes

3. **Incompatible Backend Changes**
   - Data store schema modifications incompatible with current services
   - Structural changes requiring synchronized rollouts

## Implementation Structure

### Core Infrastructure Requirements

**Traffic Management:**
- **Proxy Solutions:** Envoy, HAProxy
- **Smart Routers:** Programmable traffic routing
- **API Gateways:** Ambassador Edge Stack
- **Load Balancers:** Configurable traffic distribution

**Orchestration Platforms:**

- **DevOps Platforms:** Codefresh, Harness
- **Feature Management:** LaunchDarkly, Optimizely

### Critical Implementation Considerations

#### 1. Observability Prerequisites

- **Business Metrics:** Customer behavior, conversion rates, revenue impact
- **Real-time Monitoring:** Immediate feedback on system health

#### 2. Programmable Infrastructure
- **Dynamic Configuration:** API-driven traffic shaping
- **Automated Traffic Shifting:** Gradual percentage adjustments
- **Emergency Rollback:** Immediate traffic redirection capabilities

#### 3. GitOps Integration
- **Declarative Configuration:** Infrastructure as Code
- **Version Control:** All configurations tracked and versioned
- **Disaster Recovery:** Auditable and reproducible deployments

#### 4. Database Schema Management
- **Parallel Change Pattern:** "Expand and Contract" methodology
- **Backward Compatibility:** Existing services remain functional
- **Phased Migration:** Careful schema evolution strategy

#### 5. Context Propagation
- **Header Management:** Request identification across services
- **Token Passing:** Canary request tracking
- **Service Coordination:** Upstream service awareness

## Architecture Patterns

### Basic Canary Flow
```
[User Traffic] → [Load Balancer] → [90% → Production v1.0]
                                 → [10% → Canary v1.1]
```

### Advanced Canary with Monitoring
```
[Users] → [API Gateway] → [Traffic Split] → [Services]
                       ↓
                [Metrics Collection] → [Automated Decision Making]
                       ↓
                [Rollback/Proceed Logic]
```

## Benefits and Liabilities

### Benefits ✅

#### 1. Limited Blast Radius
- **Risk Containment:** Issues affect only small user percentage
- **Gradual Impact:** Problems discovered before widespread deployment
- **Quick Recovery:** Rapid rollback minimizes damage

#### 2. Real-World Validation
- **Production Environment:** Authentic user behavior and system load
- **Genuine Feedback:** Actual performance under real conditions
- **Risk-Free Experimentation:** Safe testing with minimal exposure

### Liabilities ❌

#### 1. Process Complexity
- **Manual Overhead:** Time-consuming without automation
- **Error Proneness:** Human intervention increases mistake risk
- **Resource Investment:** Additional infrastructure and monitoring required

#### 2. Observability Dependency
- **Monitoring Requirements:** Limited value without comprehensive instrumentation
- **Metric Interpretation:** Need skilled teams to analyze results
- **Alert Fatigue:** Balance between sensitivity and noise

#### 3. Technical Challenges
- **API Version Management:** Compatibility between old and new versions
- **Database Migration:** Schema changes require careful coordination
- **State Management:** Data structure mutability complications

## Implementation Example

### Ambassador Edge Stack Integration

The Ambassador Edge Stack API gateway (powered by CNCF Emissary-ingress) provides built-in canary release capabilities:

```yaml
# Example configuration for canary routing
apiVersion: ambassador/v2
kind: Mapping
metadata:
  name: canary-mapping
spec:
  prefix: /api/
  service: backend-service
  weight: 90
---
apiVersion: ambassador/v2
kind: Mapping
metadata:
  name: canary-mapping-v2
spec:
  prefix: /api/
  service: backend-service-v2
  weight: 10
```

This configuration routes 90% of traffic to the stable version and 10% to the canary version.

## Industry Usage

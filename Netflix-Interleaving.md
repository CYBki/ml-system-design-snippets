# Innovating Faster on Personalization Algorithms at Netflix Using Interleaving

### Article Summary
This article explains Netflix's "interleaving" technique used to accelerate the development of recommendation algorithms. Netflix uses multiple ranking algorithms to provide personalized content recommendations to over 100 million members.

### Main Problem
Traditional A/B testing:
- Takes too much time (can last weeks)
- Requires large sample groups
- Needs many users to get results

### Interleaving Solution
Netflix developed a two-stage experimentation process:

1. **First Stage (Fast Pruning)**: Quickly identify the most promising algorithms using interleaving technique
2. **Second Stage (Traditional A/B Test)**: Detailed measurements on selected algorithms

### How Interleaving Works
- Blends recommendations from two different algorithms to create a single list
- Users see recommendations from both algorithms simultaneously
- Measures which algorithm's recommendations get more viewing time
- Uses "team draft" method (like sports team selection)

### Advantages
- Requires **100x fewer users**
- Delivers results in **days**
- Shows high correlation with A/B test metrics
- Measures user preferences more sensitively

### Limitations
- Technical implementation is complex
- Only provides relative measurements
- Cannot directly measure long-term metrics like retention

## Key Technical Details

### Team Draft Interleaving Process
1. Random coin toss determines which algorithm contributes first video
2. Algorithms alternate turns selecting their highest-ranked available video
3. Process continues until the interleaved list is complete
4. User preference measured by viewing hours attributed to each algorithm

### Sensitivity Comparison
- Interleaving achieved 95% statistical power with >100x fewer users than traditional A/B metrics
- Strong correlation (high alignment) between interleaving preference and A/B test metrics
- Enables testing of broader set of algorithms in shorter timeframes

### Business Impact
- Accelerated algorithm innovation cycle
- Reduced experiment duration from weeks to days
- Increased rate of learning for recommendation improvements
- Better resource allocation for experimentation

## Analogy Used in Article
**Coke vs Pepsi Preference Study**
- Traditional A/B: Split population into two groups, one gets only Coke, other gets only Pepsi
- Interleaving approach: Give each person choice between both drinks, measure individual preferences
- Reduces uncertainty from population variation in consumption habits
- Eliminates bias from uneven distribution of heavy consumers

This interleaving methodology has become a cornerstone of Netflix's recommendation algorithm development, enabling faster innovation cycles while maintaining accuracy in preference detection.

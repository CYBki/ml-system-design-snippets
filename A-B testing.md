# A/B Testing: Complete Guide

## Definition

**A/B testing** (also known as bucket testing, split-run testing, or split testing) is a user-experience research method. A/B tests consist of randomized experiments that usually involve two variants (A and B), although the concept can be extended to multiple variants of the same variable.

It involves the application of statistical hypothesis testing or "two-sample hypothesis testing" as used in statistics. A/B testing compares multiple versions of a single variable to determine which variant is more effective.

*Example: Some users see a blue button (A), others see a green button (B). Results measure relative efficacy.*

## Key Concepts

**Simple Definition:** A/B testing is shorthand for a simple randomized controlled experiment where samples (A and B) of a single variable are compared.

**Complexity Scale:** 
- Simple A/B tests = 2 variants (simplest form)
- Adding variants increases complexity exponentially

## Practical Example: Email Campaign

A company with 2,000 customers launches an email campaign:

### Setup
- **Total audience:** 2,000 people
- **Goal:** Generate sales through website
- **Variable tested:** Call-to-action text

### Test Implementation
- **Group A (1,000 people):** "Offer ends this Saturday! Use code A1"
- **Group B (1,000 people):** "Offer ends soon! Use code B1"
- **Controls:** All other email elements identical

### Results
- **Variant A:** 5% response rate (50/1,000 used code)
- **Variant B:** 3% response rate (30/1,000 used code)
- **Conclusion:** Variant A more effective for purchases

### Important Consideration
If the goal were **clickthrough rate** instead of **purchases**, results might differ:
- Variant B might drive more website traffic
- But variant A converts more sales
- **Key takeaway:** Define clear, measurable outcomes

## Statistical Methods

### Common Test Statistics

| Distribution | Example Case | Standard Test | Alternative Test |
|--------------|-------------|---------------|------------------|
| Gaussian | Average revenue per user | Welch's t-test | Student's t-test |
| Binomial | Click-through rate | Fisher's exact test | Barnard's test |
| Poisson | Transactions per user | E-test | C-test |
| Multinomial | Product purchase numbers | Chi-squared test | G-test |
| Unknown | General cases | Mann-Whitney U test | Gibbs sampling |

### Test Selection Guidelines
- **Z-tests:** Comparing means under strict normality conditions
- **Student's t-tests:** Comparing means under relaxed conditions
- **Welch's t-test:** Most commonly used (assumes least, most robust)
- **Fisher's exact test:** Comparing binomial distributions (e.g., CTR)

## Segmentation and Targeting

### When Overall Results Can Mislead

Sometimes aggregate results hide important patterns. Consider this breakdown by gender:

| Segment | Total Sends | Responses | Variant A | Variant B |
|---------|-------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Overall** | 2,000 | 80 | 50/1,000 (5%) | 30/1,000 (3%) |
| **Men** | 1,000 | 35 | 10/500 (2%) | 25/500 (5%) |
| **Women** | 1,000 | 45 | 40/500 (8%) | 5/500 (1%) |

### Segmented Strategy Benefits
- **Overall:** Variant A appears better (5% vs 3%)
- **Reality:** Variant B better for men, Variant A better for women
- **Optimized approach:** Send B to men, A to women
- **Result:** Response rate increases from 5% to 6.5% (30% improvement)

### Design Requirements for Segmentation
- **Representative sampling:** Equal distribution across key attributes
- **Random assignment:** Both men and women randomly assigned to A/B
- **Bias prevention:** Avoid experiment bias and inaccurate conclusions

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Positives ✅
- **Clear interpretation:** Direct comparison provides unambiguous results
- **Real user preferences:** Tests actual user behavior, not assumptions
- **Specific insights:** Answers highly targeted design questions
- **Proven success:** Google tested dozens of hyperlink colors to optimize revenue

### Negatives ❌
- **Large sample requirement:** Need significant traffic for statistical significance
- **Variance sensitivity:** Results can be unstable with small samples
- **Time/resource investment:** Failed tests represent wasted effort
- **Complexity challenges:** Multiple variants increase experimental difficulty

### Variance Reduction Techniques
**CUPED (Controlled Experiment Using Pre-Experiment Data):**
- Developed by Microsoft
- Uses pre-experiment data to reduce variance
- Requires fewer samples for statistical significance
